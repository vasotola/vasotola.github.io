Welcome! I am currently a postdoc at the University of Georgia in the Sweigart Lab, but will be joining the faculty at SUNY Oneonta in Fall 2022! I am an evolutionary geneticist that works to understand and assess how species are maintained. Specifically, I combine population genetics and ecology to investigate pre- and post-mating barriers that influence reproductive isolation.
