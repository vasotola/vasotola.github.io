<h1> Welcome! </h1>

I am currently a postdoc at the University of Georgia in the Sweigart Lab, but will be joining the faculty at SUNY Oneonta in Fall 2022! 
I am an evolutionary geneticist that works to understand and assess how species are maintained. 
Specifically, I combine population genetics and ecology to investigate pre- and post-mating barriers that influence reproductive isolation.

<h1> Research Interests </h1>

I am broadly trained as both a population geneticist and ecologist, with a strong background in bioinformatics and statistics. 
I work to understanding the myriad of genetic, ecological, and demographic factors that influence reproductive isolation (speciation). 
Specifically, my research program works to understand the genetic basis and ecological drivers of reproductive isolation, 
test the importance of barriers to gene flow, and assess the consequences of introgression by integrating population and quantitative genetics and 
ecological principals in tandem with field work and experimental approaches.
