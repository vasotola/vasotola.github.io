<h1> Welcome! </h1>

Website of Alex Sotola, Assistant Professor of Bioinformatics and Genetics at SUNY Oneonta!
<br>
<br>
I am currently a postdoc at the University of Georgia in the Sweigart Lab, but will be joining the faculty at SUNY Oneonta in Fall 2022, where
I will be teaching genetics and computational biology! In addition to my love for teaching I have a passion for the outdoors, so I am a 
field biologist first, but will use any tool available to tackle interesting research questions. I consider myself an 
evolutionary geneticist that works to understand and assess how species are formed and maintained.
Specifically, I combine population genetics, ecology, and powerful computational tools to investigate pre- and post-mating barriers 
that influence reproductive isolation (speciation). 
<br>
<br>
If you are interested in genetics, ecology, or bioinformatics (or any combination of those), and are looking to 
do research in those fields, please contact me! I am always looking for folks interested in working with me.
