New publication just came out in the journal <em>Genes</em> titled "A Comparison of Non-Destructive Visceral Swab 
and Tissue Biopsy Sampling Methods for Genotyping-by-Sequencing in the Freshwater Mussel <em>Fusconaia askewi</em>" <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4425/14/6/1197">Link</a>

Our research interests revolve around ecologcial and population genetics, where we strive to answer questions pertaining to 
genetic divergence and the maintenance, or lack thereof, of species boundaries. By studying closely related species which hybridize, we are able
to assess the genetic, ecological, environmental, or behavioral barriers that may maintain those species, despite ongoing gene flow. Thus, out work 
combines population genetics, ecology, and bioinformatic tools to investigate pre- and post-mating barriers 
that influence reproductive isolation (speciation).<br>
<br>
If you are interested in genetics, evolution, or bioinformatics (or any combination of those), and are looking to 
do research in those fields, please contact me! I am always looking for folks interested in working with me.
