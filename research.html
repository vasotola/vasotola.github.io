What are the environmental, ecological, or genetic mechanisms that shape genetic structure of closely-related species? 
which pre- and/or post-mating barriers influence reproductive isolation across diverse taxa? 
How do these barriers interact and which are most influential in the process of speciation? 
How do these barriers affect the conservation of taxa of interest? 
Me and my colleagues address these very broad questions using a combination of approaches from population and quantitative genetics, 
ecology, and bioinformatics.

<h3> Genetic incompatibilities in <em>Mimulus</em> </h3>

Using F2 and recombinant inbred lines between closely related Mimulus species – <em>M. cardinalis and M. parishii </em>– 
that differ dramatically in flower morphology due to differences in mating system (outcrossing versus self-fertilizing) 
are extremely useful to assess genetic incompatibilities. With these lines we are investigating the genetic basis of post-mating 
reproductive isolation by assessing patterns of segregation distortion and inter-chromosomal linkage disequilibrium. 
This will facilitate our understanding of the molecular and biological mechanisms that promote reproductive isolation between
closely related species that have evolved drastically different life-history strategies.
