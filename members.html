<h3>Alex Sotola</h3>

<img src="/assets/img/IMG_0332.jpg" class="img-responsive" align="right" width="300px"> </div>

I am broadly trained as both a population geneticist and ecologist, with a strong background in bioinformatics and statistics. Originally from upstate 
New York, I did my undergraduate degree at SUNY Plattsburgh, doing research on flying squirrels (with Danielle Garneau) and largemouth and smallmouth bass (with Tim
Mihuc). I then worked at the University of Vermont (with Ellen Marsden) as a fisheries technician focusing on juvenile sea lamprey out-migration. 
I moved to Illinois for my master's degree at Eastern Illinois Univeristy (with Robert Colombo) where I did a population genetic 
study on channel and blue catfish in large Midwestern Rivers. Following that I moved to Texas to get my PhD at Texas State University (with Noland Martin and Tim 
Bonner; Eat 'em up!) where, among a lot of different fisheries related topics, I focused on hybridization and introgression along with phylogeography of fishes. 
I was also involved with a mark-recapture study of freshwater mussels, where we developed and implemented a Bayesian robust design mark-recapture 
model. After Texas, my postdoc was done at the University of Georgia (with Andrea Sweigart; Go Dawgs!!) working on the model system <em>Mimulus</em>, where we are 
working to understand hybrid incompatibilities between closely related species using recombinant inbred lines, in addition to a population genetics 
study of wild populations from California.

<h3>Katelin Mancusi</h3>

Katelin is an undergraduate Anthropology student who is working, with Kayla, to understand why introgression is often asymmetric between closely related species. 
She is working towards graduate school in the field of biology!

Interest in Genetics and Ecology fieldwork in the context of conservation. Passion is geared towards anthropogenic effects on ecosystems. 
I am pursuing this side of Biology because of its versatility and real-world application. I can build from my experiences and collaborate 
with other researchers to improve my understanding of the world. Biology is my desired route to a fulfilling and rewarding career.

<h3>Dalton Reagan</h3>

<img src="/assets/img/reagon.jpg" class="img-responsive" align="right" width="300px"> </div>

I am an undergraduate biology major currently assisting Dr. Sotola with Lepomis fish morphology. Geometric body morphology is an important measurement in biology which can be used to assess many different components. I will be taking measurements at different morphometric landmarks, to determine if there is hybridization between native and an invasive Lepomis species.
I spent my first two years at SUNY Oneonta with a concentration in pre-Veterinary medicine with aspirations of becoming a Veterinarian. 
I just recently changed my career path, and I am currently in the process of figuring out my next interests. 
I have experience with invasive species as I spent the summer of 2023 working as an aquatic invasive species boat steward. 
I recognize the impacts that invasive species have ecologically and how they can be used as a gauge of conservation. 
I believe that through the work and experience Dr. Sotola has granted, it will help me reach that next step in my career as a future biologist. 
I look forward to undergoing research this semester and even continuing this specific project for the years to come. 
I want to gain more field experience by collecting my own Lepomis fish samples to help strengthen my research. 
I plan on furthering my education after graduating and I have hopes of graduate school, potentially here at SUNY Oneonta. 
I have specific biological interests in fish and mammals, which I will narrow down in the coming years!

<h3>David Butler</h3>

I am an undergraduate student at SUNY Oneonta majoring in biology and adolescent education. I have a strong affinity for the natural world and all the 
fun it brings to everyday life. I grew up in the Adirondak park, and much of my free time is spent climbing and hiking in the High Peak region. 
I am doing research on the hybridization of sunfish, including invasive species, in Otsego Lake with Dr. Sotola and Dalton Reagan. 
I am taking on the genetic side of the research while Dalton focuses on the morphology of the fish.

<h3>Sage</h3>

Sage is our custom-built bioinformatic machine! We use Sage to process and analyze our genetic (and non-genetic) data. A 'sage' is not only a profoundly wise
individual (much like this machine), but also my childhood dog's name so I thought it was a fitting name for our processing powerhouse.
