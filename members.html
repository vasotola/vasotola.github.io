<h3>Alex Sotola</h3>

<img src="/assets/img/me_adks.jpg" class="img-responsive" align="right" width="300px"> </div>

I am broadly trained as both a population geneticist and ecologist, with a strong background in bioinformatics and statistics. Originally from upstate 
New York, I did my undergraduate degree at SUNY Plattsburgh, doing research on flying squirrels (with Danielle Garneau) and largemouth and smallmouth bass (with Tim
Mihuc). I then worked at the University of Vermont (with Ellen Marsden) as a fisheries technician focusing on juvenile sea lamprey out-migration. 
I moved to Illinois for my master's degree at Eastern Illinois Univeristy (with Robert Colombo) where I did a population genetic 
study on channel and blue catfish in large Midwestern Rivers. Following that I moved to Texas to get my PhD at Texas State University (with Noland Martin and Tim 
Bonner; Eat 'em up!) where, among a lot of different fisheries related topics, I focused on hybridization and introgression along with phylogeography of fishes. 
I was also involved with a mark-recapture study of freshwater mussels, where we developed and implemented a Bayesian robust design mark-recapture 
model. After Texas, my postdoc was done at the University of Georgia (with Andrea Sweigart; Go Dawgs!!) working on the model system <em>Mimulus</em>, where we are 
working to understand hybrid incompatibilities between closely related species using recombinant inbred lines, in addition to a population genetics 
study of wild populations from California.

<h2> Graduate Research Students</h2>
<h3>Darian Paul</h3>

<img src="/assets/img/paulDarian.jpg" class="img-responsive" align="right" width="300px"> </div>

Darian joined the Sotola lab in the summer of 2024. They are conducting a population genetic study on native and invasive watermilfoil species
in the Lake Champlain basin watershed. Specifically, they are interested in understanding Eurasian watermilfoil population genetics and hybridization patterns with native Northern watermilfoil.  
Darian earned their B.S. in marine biology at Texas A&M University-Corpus Christi, where they worked for the marine genomics 
lab to create qPCR assays to differentiate between cryptic species of hammerhead sharks.

<h3>Michel Ghorayeb</h3>

<img src="/assets/img/Ghorayeb.jpeg" class="img-responsive" align="right" width="300px"> </div>

He is a Biology major with a minor in Chemistry and a concentration in Pre-Medicine, and is currently enrolled in the 4+1 Masters in Biology program at SUNY Oneonta. 
He joined the lab in Fall 2024 and is working on a research project "Bridging Gaps: Racial Disparities in Medical Standards." 
His project investigates how race correlates with various medical standards by 
comparing genetic markers to physiological data. By identifying potential correlations, he aims to uncover insights into racial disparities in healthcare. 
He is passionate about addressing these issues and dedicated to advancing knowledge to promote meaningful change in medical research.

<h2> Undergraduate Research Students</h2>
<h3>Rowan Mentley-Peters</h3>

<img src="/assets/img/rowan.jpg" class="img-responsive" align="right" width="300px"> </div>

He is interested in genetics and ecology fieldwork in the context of conservation. His passion is geared towards anthropogenic effects on ecosystems. 
He is pursuing this side of biology because of its versatility and real-world application. He is looking to build from his experiences and collaborate 
with other researchers to improve my understanding of the world. Biology is my desired route to a fulfilling and rewarding career. His research, in collaboration
with Dr. Stich at SUNY Oneonta, focuses on determining if different migration behaviors of American Shad has a genetic basis.

<h3>Dalton Reagan</h3>

<img src="/assets/img/reagon.jpg" class="img-responsive" align="right" width="300px"> </div>

He is an undergraduate biology major currently assisting Dr. Sotola with sunfish (Lepomis) fish morphology (in collaboration with David Butler). 
Geometric body morphology is an important measurement in biology which can be used to assess many different components. 
He will be taking measurements at different morphometric landmarks, to determine if there is hybridization between native and an invasive Lepomis species.
He spent my first two years at SUNY Oneonta with a concentration in pre-Veterinary medicine with aspirations of becoming a Veterinarian. 
He just recently changed his career path, and is currently in the process of figuring out his interests. 
He has experience with invasive species as he spent the summer of 2023 working as an aquatic invasive species boat steward. 
He recognizes the impacts that invasive species have ecologically and how they can be used as a gauge of conservation. 
He believes that through the work and experience Dr. Sotola has granted, it will help him reach that next step in his career as a biologist. 
He is looking forward to undergoing research this semester and even continuing this specific project for the years to come. 
He plans on furthering his education after graduating and I have hopes of graduate school, potentially here at SUNY Oneonta.

<h3>David Butler</h3>

<img src="/assets/img/IMG_1664.jpeg" class="img-responsive" align="right" width="300px"> </div>

He is an undergraduate student at SUNY Oneonta majoring in biology and adolescent education. He has a strong affinity for the natural world and all the 
fun it brings to everyday life. He grew up in the Adirondak Park, and much of his free time is spent climbing and hiking in the High Peak region. 
He is doing research on hybridization of sunfish, including invasive species, in Otsego Lake with Dr. Sotola and Dalton Reagan. 
He is leading the genetic side of the research while Dalton focuses on the morphology of the fish.

<h3>Sage</h3>

<img src="/assets/img/sage.jpg" class="img-responsive" align="right" width="300px"> </div>

Sage is our custom-built bioinformatic machine! We use Sage to process and analyze our genetic (and non-genetic) data. A 'sage' is not only a profoundly wise
individual (much like this machine), but also my childhood dog's name so I thought it was a fitting name for our processing powerhouse.
