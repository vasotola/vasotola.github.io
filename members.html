I am broadly trained as both a population geneticist and ecologist, with a strong background in bioinformatics and statistics. Originally from upstate 
New York, I did my undergraduate degree at SUNY Plattsburgh, doing research on flying squirrels (with Danielle Garneau) and largemouth and smallmouth bass (with Tim
Mihuc). I then worked at the University of Vermont (with Ellen Marsden) as a fisheries technician focusing on juvenile sea lamprey out-migration. 
I moved to Illinois for my master's degree at Eastern Illinois Univeristy (with Robert Colombo) where I did a population genetic 
study on channel and blue catfish in large Midwestern Rivers. Following that I moved to Texas to get my PhD at Texas State University (with Noland Martin and Tim 
Bonner; Eat 'em up!) where, among a lot of different fisheries related topics, I focused on hybridization and introgression along with phylogeography of fishes. 
I was also involved with a mark-recapture study of freshwater mussels, where we developed and implemented a Bayesian robust design mark-recapture 
model. After Texas, my postdoc was done at the University of Georgia (with Andrea Sweigart; Go Dawgs!!) working on the model system <em>Mimulus</em>, where we are 
working to understand hybrid incompatibilities between closely related species using recombinant inbred lines, in addition to a population genetics 
study of wild populations from California.

<h3>Katelin Mancusi</h3>

Katelin is an undergraduate Anthropology student who is working, with Kayla, to understand why introgression is often asymmetric between closely related species. 
She is working towards graduate school in the field of biology!

<h3>Sage</h3>

Sage is our custom-built bioinformatic machine! We use Sage to process and analyze our genetic (and non-genetic) data. A 'sage' is not only a profoundly wise
individual (much like this machine), but also my childhood dog's name so I thought it was a fitting name for our processing powerhouse.
