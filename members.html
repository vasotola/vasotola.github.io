I am broadly trained as both a population geneticist and ecologist, with a strong background in bioinformatics and statistics. Originally from upstate 
New York, I did my undergraduate degree at SUNY Plattsburgh, then worked at the University of Vermont (with Ellen Marsden) as a fisheries technician focusing
on juvenile sea lamprey out-migration, before moving to Illinois for my master's degree at Eastern Illinois Univeristy (with Robert Colombo) where I did a population genetic 
study on channel and blue catfish in the Wabash River. Following that I moved to Texas to get my PhD at Texas State University (with Noland Martin and Tim 
Bonner) where I studied hybridization and introgression along with phylogeography of fishes. I was also involved with a mark-recapture study of freshwater 
mussels. My postdoc was done at the University of Georgia (with Andrea Sweigart) working on the model system <em>Mimulus</em>, where we are attempting to 
understand hybrid incompatibilities between closely related species. Through this, my research program works to understand the genetic basis 
and ecological drivers of reproductive isolation, test the importance of barriers to gene flow, and assess the consequences of introgression by 
integrating population and quantitative genetics and ecological principals with field work and experimental approaches. Into the future I would like to
focus my research on conservation and species of interest.
